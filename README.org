* Assignment 1 evaluation

Almost all features are implemented (tunnel teleportation not implemented), however the movement of pacman is not fluid. The rendering looks efficient to me.

My major critique is that you have included almost all in the same file which does not show good modularization. Also you get a floating point exception (zero division in main:314 when prevDir == 0).

All in all the work is ok. My evaluation is **B**
